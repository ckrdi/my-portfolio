          Hello there. My name is Cokorda Agung Yudhana, I live in Lombok, ID.
          The first time I found programming was in 2016 when I was starting
          blogging. I thought it would be cool to have a website of your own.
          Then I stumbled upon programming languages, people who have a career
          in programming, and how they build something so awesome. I want to be
          cool like them. In 2019 I finally decided that I wanted to make a
          career in web development so I started learning some programming
          language. The first language I learned was Python, but in the end, I
          learn Javascript language and now I know how to build web apps using
          React and other Javascript libraries.
        </p>
